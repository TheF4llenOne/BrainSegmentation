## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to accurately segment tumor regions in brain scans, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment planning of cancer.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes annotated MRI brain scans, where each pixel is labeled as either tumor or non-tumor.

## Model Architecture
The model is based on the **U-Net architecture**, featuring an encoder-decoder structure.

## Training and Evaluation
The model was trained for 100 epochs, achieving a maximum IoU of 70%.

## Future Work
Future work includes experimenting with other architectures and applying advanced preprocessing techniques (filters or the usage of GANs to generate synthesized images with higher resolution.
